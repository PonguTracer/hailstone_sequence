# 25.7 LAB: Hailstone sequence

Given a positive integer n, the following rules will always create a sequence that ends with 1, called the hailstone sequence:

If n is even, divide it by 2
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 (i.e. 3n +1)
Continue until n is 1
Write a program that reads an integer as input and prints the hailstone sequence starting with the integer entered. Format the output so that ten integers, each separated by a tab character (\t), are printed per line.

The output format can be achieved as follows:
print(n, end='\t')
